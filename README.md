**2.** In the file `main.py` there are three fields that need to be filled. These are cookie values from Linkedin.

 - li_at
 - li_a
 - jsessionid

Use the below extension to easily access all of these cookies which you can paste directly into the file

**3.** Now you can do `python main.py` in your terminal to run the program. 

You will be prompted for a URL. Go setup your search on sales-nav with your filters/keywords etc and then simply copy the URL and paste into the program. 

# Extra Information

 - If it was not evident. You will need a sales navigator license for your Linkedin account.
 - A list of fields exported
	- Full Name
	- Current Job Title
	- Current Company
	- Current Industry*
	- Tenure
	- Location
	- Linkedin Profile URL
	- Linkedin Company URL
	- Company URL
	- Company URL
	- Employee Count*
	(*) of the company they are working for

 - You can only export 2500 users per search(url). This is a hard limit. However, you can bypass it by setting different filters to split up the totals into multiple URL's. 
 - It is highly recommended to export at MAXIMUM 2500 users per day to limit your chance of having your account suspended. You can increase this amount as you 'warm up' your account with daily exports.
